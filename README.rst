EasyTimeTable
#############

EASYTIMETABLE is a software created during group projects, at the SUPINFO 
school. The original goal was to have a simple way to manage campuses,
universities and class calendars, as of pedagogy content.

We have used Django in order to accomplish this, and it result in this
application. You could find all the useful documents about the features, the
installation procedure, in restructured text, using the "documentation" branch.
